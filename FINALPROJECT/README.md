Steps for Harvard Key Authentication:
1.	Visit the following website: https://vault.cs50.io/
2.	Insert https://[insert cs50 ide github url here]-5000.githubpreview.dev/ to get the vault link
3.	Now return to the CS50 ide and type the following: flask run
4.	Now use the vault link created earlier to direct yourself to the website and login with Harvard key.
The steps above needed to happen because our project was local to the CS50 IDE meaning that it becomes extremely difficult to allow people to access our website with the authentication factor since the Harvard Key authentication factor redirects to our personal CS50 IDEâ€™s. If we were to have a domain name and a separate server, we could implement Harvard Key authentication without the steps above since the link to our website would always be the same.

After logging in through Harvard Key, you are welcomed to the homepage of Crimson Marketplace. There, you will see an animated logo video playing in a loop as well as the title "Crimson Marketplace". In the top-right of your screen, you will see the following: Buy, Sell, View Listings, Contact, and Logout. To navigate to any of these, press their respective button.

In sell, you will be prompted with a form that has a variety of different fields. First, it is important to mention that all of these fields are required, since they are needed to create a post. Enter all of the information about your posting and upload an image off of your computer. At this point all of the fields should be filled out and there will be a preview of your item's photo. From there, you can submit the form. After
submission, the website will notify you that you successfully submitted a listing. Once you check the buy page, the listing will be there

In buy, you will be able to view the listings made by a user. There, you'll be able to see all the contents of the sell field packed in a nice card with its respective image. You will also have access to their email so as to be able to contact the seller if you're interested in the product. All of these images and posts are updated dynamically, so if somebody decides to sell a new listing, it will appear on the buy page with a quick refresh. Also, if a student would like to delete their listing for any particular reason, they can hit the delete button.
This will redirect the user to a page where they verify their credentials and only then can sell the product. Lastly, after deleting a 
list, a pop-up will show, saying that the item was deleted successfully.

In contact, you will be able to view pictures of the founders of the project, along with a short description of them. You will also be able to view their email that is clickable and redirects you to a mail to function for convenience. There, users who encounter any problems or have questions about the marketplace will be able to contact the developers.

In view listings, users will be able to sort through all the listings by a users email. If a purchaser has a specific seller in mind, they will be able to filter by their listings. This makes it convenient for the user by keeping these organized and less out of place. They can use 
both fields or either one to help narrow their search.

Logout will redirect you to the Harvard Key page and from there, you can navigate the website once again.
